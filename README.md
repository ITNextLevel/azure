# Powershell scripts for common tasks related to scoping Azure environments
Here are some short scripts I have written for common tasks I do when scoping Azure environments. I will populate this repo as I write more scripts. the first set uploaded looks at diagnostic logs settings to help determine if these are being collected, where they are going and help calculate costs, misconfiguration, and possible log overconsumption in Sentinel. 

Reach out if you have any questions.
